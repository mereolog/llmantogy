This repository contains the scripts and their outcomes for a research project whose aim is to test the capability of large language models to formalise natural language text in the context of a formal ontology.

If you run startup.py file, you will be directed through the whole process that consists of:

1. finding texts that are similar to text from inputs/examples.py
1. formalising these texts into CLIF theories
1. checking whether CLIF theories are syntactically well-formed
1. checking whether CLIF theories are consistent
1. checking whether CLIF theories are consistent with DOLCE ontology
1. checking whether CLIF theories are semantically adequate

Note that the last step requires a human interaction.
